# Image-Classification-using-Sagemaker
This project trains a deep learning model to classify dog breeds using a pretrained ResNet18 architecture. It leverages Amazon SageMaker for scalable training, automatic hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, batch size), and model profiling/debugging via SageMaker Debugger.
